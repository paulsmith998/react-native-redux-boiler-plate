This is WIP and just meant as a bit of boiler plate including react native, redux and 
immutable in one place so that I get started quicker and learn about how these 
technologies interact.

If you intend to use initialise your react native project with your app name

ie... react-native init [appNmae]

this will create the project clone this into the same directory overwriting files where necessary

and lastly run npm install

The boiler plate doesn't do much it loads a component using a reducer to set a state variable to 
screen. But it is meant to get me off the ground with learning to develop using this framework 
coming from an angular background.
